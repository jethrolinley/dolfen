Time-domain Gravitational Wave Inference
========================================

``dolfen`` was created for the specific problem of simulated parameter estimation of long-duration, slow-evolution waveforms from low to intermediate mass compact binary coalescences (which will be) present in the data recorded by the LISA gravitational wave observatory. In this case, working in the time- rather than frequency-domain can be particularly useful for detailed modelling of the waveform, as some time-dependent processes are expected to have significant impact on the production and propagation, and thus ultimately the morphology of the waveforms.
